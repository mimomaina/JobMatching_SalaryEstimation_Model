                                Job Matching & Salary Estimation Model
Project Overview
This project aims to help job seekers find the best-matching tech roles based on their skills, experience geographical location and education while providing a salary estimate based on various job-related factors. The model will predict the most suitable job for a user and estimate their expected salary range based on location, qualifications, experience, and company size

Objectives
1. Job Matching: Recommend the best job role based on a user's input (skills, experience, education).
2. Salary Estimation: Predict an estimated salary based on relevant job factors.
3. Automation Risk Assessment: Indicate the likelihood of automation for a suggested job role.

Users will input:

Country & City (for localized salary estimates)
Experience Level (Entry, Mid, Senior)
Qualifications (Diploma, Bachelor's, Master's, etc.)
Skills (Python, SQL, Cloud, etc.)
The model will then output:

The best-matching job title
The predicted salary range
The automation risk associated with the role
