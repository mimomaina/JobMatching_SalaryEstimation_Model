Job Matching & Salary Estimation Model
Project Overview

This project aims to help job seekers find the best-matching tech roles based on their skills, experience geographical location and education while providing a salary estimate based on various job-related factors. The model will predict the most suitable job for a user and estimate their expected salary range based on location, qualifications, experience, and company size

Objectives

1. Job Matching: Recommend the best job role based on a user's input (skills, experience, education).
2. Salary Estimation: Predict an estimated salary based on relevant job factors.
3. Automation Risk Assessment: Indicate the likelihood of automation for a suggested job role.

Users will input:

  1.Country & City (for localized salary estimates)

  2.Experience Level (Entry, Mid, Senior)

  3.Qualifications (Diploma, Bachelor's, Master's, etc.)

  4.Skills (Python, SQL, Cloud, etc.)

The model will then output:

  1.The best-matching job title

  2.The predicted salary range

  3.The automation risk associated with the role

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
 
a.Handling Missing Values: Drop missing values in Company Profile

b.Feature Encoding: Convert categorical data (e.g., experience level, job type) into numerical format

c.Feature Scaling: Standardize salary data and Company Size.

2. Model Development
 
  a.Salary Prediction-XGBoost Regressor/Random Forest Regressor

  b.Job Matching - Random Forest Classifier/XGBoost Classifier

3. Model Evaluation
   
  a.Salary Prediction Evaluation: MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  
  b.Job Matching Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score

4.Deployment Plan â€“ Streamlit App

The project will be deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application where users can enter their details and receive:

  1.A recommended job title
  
  2.A predicted salary range
  
  3.An automation risk score
